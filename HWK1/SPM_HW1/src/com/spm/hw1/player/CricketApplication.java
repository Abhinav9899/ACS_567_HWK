 * receiving a list of choices including Enter 0 to read player data,
 *  Enter 1 to add player data, Enter 2 to edit player data, 
 *  Enter 3 to delete player data, Enter 4 to delete all player data, 
 *  Enter 5 to calculate mean and median values of all the runs scored by the players, 
 *  Enter 6 to filter player data by year, Enter 9 to exit the application. And based on the userâ€™s input the selected operation would be performed and the respective result would be displayed.
